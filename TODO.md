# Nice to have features for next release (1.0)

* Manage actions: some sort of scripting language

# Possible future features

* Auto-discover Hue bridge without relying on Philips (ssdp discovery needs to be implemented, can't be done in pure qml/js)
* Scenes based on image files
* Manage lights, groups and schedules in the config dialogue

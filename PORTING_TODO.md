# Must have
* Restore functionality: Action Items
* Restore configurability: Everything other than the bridge
* Base UX: better list items that show hover state
* Restore GUI: busy and unconfigured views
* UI cleanup: margins (e.g. top of list views)

# Should have
* Keyboard navigation
* More modern GUI elements such as switches

# Nice to have
* Some new Hue features / update to the latest UI
* Code cleanup: remove duplications, clean up the bridge communication code a lot
* Wheel and middle click events, maybe?
